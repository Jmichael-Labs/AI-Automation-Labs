[VISUAL: Split screen - frustrated professional vs successful automation]

The {industry} industry has a problem. Professionals are spending 60% of their time on repetitive tasks that could be automated. But most people don't know about {tool_data['name']}.

[VISUAL: {tool_data['name']} interface showcase]

{tool_data['name']} is a {tool_data['description']} that's specifically designed for {industry} workflows. Here's what makes it different:

[VISUAL: Feature breakdown infographic]

1. INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION: Unlike basic tools, {tool_data['name']} learns your specific {industry} patterns
2. INDUSTRY INTEGRATION: Built-in connections to every major {industry} platform
3. SCALABLE RESULTS: Users report {tool_data.get('income_potential', '$2,500/month')} in time savings

[VISUAL: Case study timeline]

Take Sarah, a {industry} professional who implemented {tool_data['name']} in January. By March, she had automated 70% of her routine tasks. By June, she was generating an additional {tool_data.get('income_potential', '$2,500/month')} in revenue.

[VISUAL: Step-by-step implementation guide]

Here's exactly how to implement {tool_data['name']}:

WEEK 1: Setup and Integration
- Connect your existing {industry} tools
- Configure basic automation rules
- Test with small workflows

WEEK 2-3: Optimization
- Analyze performance data
- Refine automation triggers
- Scale successful workflows

WEEK 4+: Advanced Features
- Implement AI-powered decisions
- Create complex multi-step automations
- Monitor ROI and optimize

[VISUAL: Future prediction infographic]

The future of {industry} is automated. By 2026, professionals using tools like {tool_data['name']} will have a massive competitive advantage. Those who don't adapt will be left behind.

WHITEBOARD STYLE:
- Clean white background like a real whiteboard
- Hand-drawn black sketches and diagrams
- Simple stick figures and basic shapes
- Handwritten-style text labels
- Connecting arrows drawn by hand
- Mathematical equations and formulas if relevant
- Informal, sketch-like appearance

CONTENT TO INCLUDE IN ONE IMAGE:
1. PROBLEM SECTION (top-left): Stick figure looking frustrated at desk with papers scattered
2. SOLUTION SECTION (center): {tool_data['name']} drawn as simple interface box with arrows
3. WORKFLOW SECTION (middle): Step-by-step process: Input → {tool_data['name']} → Output → Results
4. BENEFITS SECTION (right): Hand-drawn charts showing:
   - Time saved: Clock with arrow
   - Money saved: Dollar signs
   - Efficiency: Upward trending graph
5. STATISTICS (bottom): Simple bar chart showing "{tool_data.get('income_potential', '$2,500/month')}" ROI
6. CALL-TO-ACTION (bottom-right): "Join {industry} professionals using this!" in handwritten style

VISUAL ELEMENTS:
- Hand-drawn arrows connecting all sections
- Simple icons (lightbulb for ideas, gear for process, etc.)
- Sketch-style borders around sections
- Handwritten labels and titles
- Mathematical formulas or process equations where relevant
- Simple flowchart elements

INDUSTRY CONTEXT: Adapt terminology and icons specifically for {industry} sector
TONE: Educational, approachable, like a teacher explaining on a real whiteboard
SIZE: Comprehensive enough to be the ONLY visual needed - contains all information
